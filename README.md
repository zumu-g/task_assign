- **Individual Configuration**: Per-task assignee allocation and due date specification
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic task ordering based on workflow dependencies
- **Custom Fields**: Dynamic form generation for template-specific data collection

### Predefined Templates
- **Client Onboarding** (14 days, 8 tasks): Welcome email â†’ kickoff meeting â†’ tool setup â†’ requirements gathering
- **Critical Bug Fix** (3 days, 6 tasks): Reproduce â†’ investigate â†’ develop fix â†’ code review â†’ QA â†’ deploy
- **Feature Development** (21 days, 7 tasks): Analysis â†’ design â†’ development â†’ testing â†’ documentation â†’ deployment
- **Marketing Campaign** (30 days, 6 tasks): Strategy â†’ content creation â†’ design â†’ setup â†’ launch â†’ optimization

### Template Management
- **Template Builder**: Visual interface for creating custom workflow templates
- **Role-Based Assignment**: Assign tasks by role (developer, designer, PM) with automatic user resolution
- **Offset Scheduling**: Define relative due dates (Day 0, Day +2, etc.) for automatic date calculation
- **Template Library**: Organized collection with search, filtering, and categorization
- **Import/Export**: Share templates across teams and projects

### Usage Workflow
1. **Trigger Recognition**: AI detects standard triggers in inbox items
2. **Template Selection**: Choose from matching templates or browse library
3. **Configuration**: Customize assignees, dates, and template-specific fields
4. **Preview**: Review all tasks before creation with dependency visualization
5. **Bulk Creation**: Generate all tasks simultaneously with proper relationships

This system transforms repetitive task creation into efficient workflow orchestration while maintaining FlowAI's AI-powered simplicity.
